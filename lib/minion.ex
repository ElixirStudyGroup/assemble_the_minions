  Responsible for handling :hello messages.

  Call signatures take 3 parameters, the incoming message (which is of course pattern matched and of arbitrary complexity).

  _from is the process ID from the calling process (we're ignoring it here)

  state is the current state of hte process.  As we see in `start_link` we've initialized the process with a map, which has a `name` entry, this allows up to look that up.

  Call's reply to the caller using a tuple. which has a specific signature.

  :reply says that we are sending a reply (yeah, I know you needed the explanation)
  The second element is the message or thing we wish to return.
  The third element is state, this is how the process continues to maintain state.
